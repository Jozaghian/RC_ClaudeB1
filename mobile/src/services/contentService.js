You may not copy, sell, modify, or distribute our Services or Content without written permission.

## 4. Fees and Payments

Ride Club may introduce service fees, subscription fees, or other charges. We reserve the right to update or change fees at any time, with or without prior notice. By continuing to use the Services after such changes, you agree to the updated fees.

You acknowledge that Ride Club does not perform criminal background checks and does not guarantee the conduct of Members. You are solely responsible for your safety and decisions when arranging rides.

## 6. Account Suspension and Termination

We may suspend or terminate your account at any time, without notice, if you violate these Terms, misuse the Services, or if necessary for security or legal reasons.
